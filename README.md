# Numerical-Methods
Projects on numerical methods and visualizations. This includes numerical schemes of simple dynamic systems, graphical displays of system evolution, and flow visualization of streamlines in potential flow theory.

These projects are part of my self-learning and pursuit in computational physics and simulation methods. Much of the code is in progress.
